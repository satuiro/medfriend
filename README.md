### Descriptoion of the project: 
This project is made for DevJam Hackathon Season 1 with the use of OpenAI API. 

### Tagline
This project takes into the _physical records_ of the person such as _age_, _sex_, _height_, _weight_, _diet type_, _allergies_ and previous _health records_.<br />
On the basis of the provided responses it provides with a _rating_ of your _BMI_ and calculate the perfect _BMR_ and plans a perfect _diet_ for him alongwith some _workouts_ and _cardio plans_.

### Problem it is Solving
Made for the masses who are always looking into the web for their health and fitness, but misses out the various important factors to take into consideration before starting to act into that. Even if they start listing it out into their searches it will kill a lot of their time.<br />
So as to reduce each and every step from these set of actions and the time killed to perform those actions, this project was developed.

### Challenges we faced
While making of this project we came across the challenge of working in a remote team, as per we look into the experience of each member there was a lack of communication between the members as we were not able to be present and working together in person. Another challenge we looked was using new technologies to configure in our app, for few of our team members making this project was a whole new experience as it taught us many new exposure and gave a chance to excel further in our career.
